# AI-BASED-VIRTUAL-DESKTOP-ASSISTANT
AI BASED VIRTUAL DESKTOP ASSISSTANT
Inspiration
I got inspiration from Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alex.

What it does???
The user is able to talk with the virtual assistant and based on certain words or phrases the user uses, then the virtual assistant will talk back to you.

How we built it?
I built this on Python and used speech recognition, web browser, PyAudio, and a lot more imports to make this work.

What's next for AI Based virtual desktop Assisstant:
Hoping to add more personalities to Virtual Assisstant to make the interaction more enjoyable and memorable. Another thing to improve is to have virtual desktop assistant be able to respond to more commands.
